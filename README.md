# Flags of the World Project

<!-- [Live Site](FILL IN HERE) -->

## Goals
- To cement my knowledge of React including functional components and hooks
- To explore the use of React Router for front end routing and single-page functionality

## Features
Users can:
- See all countries from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) on the homepage
- Filter countries by region
- Search for countries by name
- Click on a country to see detailed information and links to all bordering countries
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark modes

## Technologies Used
- React - page framework and all components
- React Router - browser routing for single-page functionality
- Create React App - library used for project setup with a customized template
- HTML5 - as JSX within React
- CSS - styling and media breakpoints for responsive design
- JavaScript / ES6 - importing/exporting modules, fetching from API, conditional logic and mapping within React elements
- Google Fonts - custom fonts library
- Ionicons - open-source icon library
- Postman - testing API endpoints and exploring response data structures
- Git / GitHub - version control
- Netlify - hosting with continuous deployment from GitHub

## Possible Future Improvements
- Further split out container components from presentational components
- Add additional filtering options (sub-region)
- Add additional search options (capital, language, country code, etc.)
- Store last search parameters used on main page so when back button is clicked the same results display
- Determine how to pass light mode / dark mode choice when redirecting to the error page
- Explore additional styling libraries such as Bootstrap, Sass, or Tailwind
